# Crimes in Vancouver
This is a Jupyter Notebook exploring the crimes in Vancouver from the years 2003 - 2018 for my Data Science Project at BrainStation, using python.

The purpose of this analysis is to answer three questions:
1. What is the most common crime in Vancouver ?
2. What is the most dangerous neighbourhood in Vancouver?
3. Are the crime rates increasing or decreasing ?
4. Which days of the week, do we experience the most crimes?
